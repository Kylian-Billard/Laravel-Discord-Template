# Laravel-Discord-Template

This template allows Laravel User to make the good part of Laravel 10 and PHP for creating a bot.

You want to use Eloquent for any reasons or maybe make stats from the bot. It's the template your are looking for ! 

# How to use it ? 

## DOCKER : 

I prepare and test it a DockerFile just for you! You can just build it and make a container for a docker! (I use it like this.). You have all the extensions needed activated for basic usage.

PS: You may need to active some for Vocal usage.

```
docker build -t your-name . 
```
